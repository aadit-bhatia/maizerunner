Hi! Welcome to Maize-Runner, a student-led trading algorithm specializing in corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade. We utilize a trading signal based on one week and one month projections of next-month continuous futures. Our process of identifying X variables, predicting future prices, and creating a signal can be viewed in single_security_strat.ipynb. We look to generalize this model to a broader array of agricultural futures going forward. Please contact bhatia.aad@northeastern.edu for inquiries.
